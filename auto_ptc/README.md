# AUTO PTC account creator

A simple tool to create Pokémon Trainer Club (PTC) accounts in batches.

## About

This program allows me to generate PTC accounts, with the current setup achieving around **five accounts per hour**. 

> **Note**: I haven't yet implemented a proxy or VPN system—that's on my to-do list. 

YOU NEED CHROME INSTALLED
and the below extension
For generating emails, I use the **Email Generator** Chrome extension. You can find it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/email-generator/nopbpkakbijkbhfcofpmfkdkdgbcjpec?hl=en).
